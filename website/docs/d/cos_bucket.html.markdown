# ibm\_cos_bucket

Get information about already existing buckets.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_resource_group" "cos_group" {
  name = "cos-resource-group"
}

data "ibm_resource_instance" "cos_instance" {
  name              = "cos-instance"
  resource_group_id = data.ibm_resource_group.cos_group.id
  service           = "cloud-object-storage"
}

data "ibm_cos_bucket" "standard-ams03" {
  bucket_name          = "a-standard-bucket-at-ams"
  resource_instance_id = data.ibm_resource_instance.cos_instance.id
  bucket_type          = "single_site_location"
  bucket_region        = "ams03"
}

output "bucket_private_endpoint" {
  value = data.ibm_cos_bucket.standard-ams03.s3_endpoint_private
}
```
